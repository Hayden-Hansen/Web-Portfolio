# Web-Portfolio

I built this web portfolio using React and Tailwind after I watched Clint's tutorial on how to build a web portfolio on his YoutTube channel 
(link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kg0z1qNrkw).

Clint gives a great explanantion of how a web portfolio should be formatted, along with providing us with a great foundation to learn Tailwind!

Once I completed Chris' tutorial, I completely re-did my portfolio with my exact specifications in mind. 

At the minimum, your portfolio should include these sections:
- About
- Projects
- Contact

Completing Chris' tutorial will give you the confidence and skills necessary to create the best version of your portfolio using React and Tailwind. 

Enjoy!
